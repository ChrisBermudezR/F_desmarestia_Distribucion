## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r  echo=FALSE}
require(leaflet)
Occ_Data<-read.table("Fdesmarestia_Occ_totales.csv", header = TRUE, sep=",")
leaflet(Occ_Data) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
  setView(lng = 0, lat = 0, zoom = 1) %>%
  addMarkers(
  clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()
)
 
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
